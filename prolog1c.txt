1a. An association list is a list of pairs, also known as conses, where each cons is an association. The car of the pair is called its 
KEY and the cdr of the pair is called its DATUM.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1b. Given the association list ((a.b) (c.d) (r.x) (s.y) (r.z)), the assoc function goes through all pairs in the association list and 
finds the first pair whose key is r (as given in the question for assoc( ‘r ‘ a-list)) and returns the datum of that pair. 
If there is no key which equals r, nil is returned.

1c. MAPCAN applies a function f(x) to each element in a list. The element returned from the function is appended to a resulting list. 
For eg: (mapcan (lambda (x) (list (+ x 10) 'x)) '(1 2 3 4)) => (11 X 12 X 13 X 14 X)
In this example, every element in the list is incremented by 10 and a resulting list is made with the new elements.

1d. To make a basic hash table in lisp:
	(setq a (make-hash-table)) 
To write something in the hash table:
	(setf (gethash 'color a) 'brown) 
	(setf (gethash 'name a) 'fred)
To read something or get a value from a hash table:
	(gethash 'color a) => brown 
	(gethash 'name a) => fred 
	(gethash 'pointy a) => nil

1e. sublis makes substitutions for objects in tree (a structure of conses). Sublis looks at all subtrees and leaves of tree; if a 
subtree or leaf appears as a key in association list, it is replaced by the object with which that key is associated. This operation 
is non-destructive. If sublis succeeds, a new copy of tree is returned in which each occurrence of such a subtree or leaf is replaced 
by the object with which it is associated. If no changes are made, the original tree is returned. The original tree is left unchanged, 
but the result tree may share cells with it.
For eg: (sublis '((x . 100) (z . zprime))
         '(plus x (minus g z x p) 4 . x))
=>  (PLUS 100 (MINUS G ZPRIME 100 P) 4 . 100)

1f. Binding variables in prolog are used to give a value to a variable. It mostly occurs while making rules in prolog or to satisfy 
the goals of a query in prolog.

1h. gensym creates and returns a fresh, uninterned symbol, as if by calling make-symbol. But the only difference between gensym and 
make-symbol is in how the new symbol’s name is determined. The symbol is prefixed by G and a decimal representation of a number.
